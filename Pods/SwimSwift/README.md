# Swim Swift SDK

Swim makes it easy to build realtime apps that connect seamlessly to ultra
responsive, highly scalable [Swim services](https://github.com/swimit/swim)
running in the cloud.

The Swim Swift SDK is specifically for writing iPhone and iPad apps that use
Swim services as a backend.

To get started writing reactive Swim services, check out the
[SwimJS](https://github.com/swimit/swimjs) server runtime.
